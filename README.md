# Jesse, We Have To Cook! üß™

Keep your Mac awake and stay active in Slack, Teams, and other apps. A simple menu bar utility inspired by everyone's favorite chemistry teacher.

## What It Does

JWHTC sits in your menu bar (look for the flask icon ‚öóÔ∏è) and helps you:

- **Stay Awake** - Prevents your Mac from sleeping or starting the screensaver
- **Stay Active** - Keeps your status as "active" in communication apps
- **Stay in Control** - Customize how often it sends activity signals (5 seconds to 3 minutes)

Perfect for those long video calls, presentations, or when you just need to step away without going "idle."
